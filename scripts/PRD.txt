# Overview
A global web-based platform for young football (soccer) talents, connecting players (and their parents), academies, scouts, trainers, managers, clubs, and fans. The platform enables discovery, tracking, and support for young players, and provides tools for clubs and professionals to find and monitor talent. The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and easily upgradeable for future features.

# Core Features

  - Exclusive roles: Player, Coach, Scout, Manager, Trainer, Club, Fan
  - Parents act as proxies for player accounts (no separate parent role)
  - Role-based profile fields and permissions
  - Referral system: All users can generate referral links to invite others and earn points for future rewards/premium membership (future-proofed in database design)

- **Player Profiles**
  - Fields: Country, city, age, height, weight, preferred foot, positions (selectable on a football field UI, multiple allowed except for goalkeepers), languages spoken, current club, achievements, medical info, social links
  - Verification: Age and achievements can be verified via a link to the official FIFA "COMET Football" app or similar
  - Parental consent required for underage users

- **Video Uploads**

# Technical Architecture
- **System Components**

  - Media storage: Local server (MVP), with future migration to cloud/YouTube
  - Email service for verification, notifications, and parental consent
  - Role-based access control
  - Moderation dashboard for video/content approval and abuse reports

- **Data Models**
  - User (with role, profile, referral, premium status, parental consent)
  - PlayerProfile (with all player-specific fields)
  - Video (with status, moderation, storage info)
  - Message (with sender, recipient, status, block info)
  - Watchlist
  - TrainingPlan
  - Report/Ban

- **APIs and Integrations**
  - COMET Football (for verification)
  - Email provider (SendGrid, SMTP, etc.)
  - YouTube API (future)

- **Infrastructure Requirements**
  - Scalable web server (Docker-ready)
  - Secure media storage
  - GDPR-compliant data handling

# Development Roadmap
- **MVP Requirements**
  - Role-based registration and login
  - Player profile creation and verification
  - Video upload with moderation
  - One-to-one messaging with limits and blocking/reporting
  - Search and watchlist
  - Training plan creation
  - Admin/moderator dashboard
  - Premium membership logic (3 months free, then upgrade path)
  - GDPR and parental consent flows

- **Future Enhancements**
  - Referral and reward system
  - Voting system for videos
  - Multi-language support
  - Cloud/YouTube video storage
  - Advanced analytics and reporting
  - Event management, live streaming, API access
  - Ads and sponsorship modules

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Foundation: User registration, role management, and authentication
- Player profile and parental consent flows
- Video upload and moderation
- Messaging and blocking/reporting
- Search and watchlist
- Training plans
- Premium logic
- Admin/moderator tools
- Future: Referral/rewards, voting, analytics, events, multi-language, cloud integrations

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Technical challenges:** Video storage and moderation at scale (mitigate by starting with local storage, planning for cloud migration)
- **MVP scoping:** Focus on core flows, defer voting/referral to later
- **Resource constraints:** Modular architecture for incremental development
- **Compliance:** GDPR and parental consent built-in from start
