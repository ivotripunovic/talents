    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Role-Based User Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a Django-based role-based authentication system with 7 different user roles, custom registration flows, parent-child relationships, and email verification into 6 distinct subtasks with clear deliverables",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the multiple user roles, custom registration flows, parent-child relationships, and integration with Django's authentication system. It requires database modeling, form validation, email systems, and security considerations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Player Profile Management",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the player profile management system implementation into 5 subtasks covering the data model, UI components (including the football field position selector), parental consent workflow, verification system, and privacy controls",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex data modeling with many fields, specialized UI components (football field), integration with external systems (COMET Football), and compliance features (parental consent). The interdependencies between these components increase complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Build Video Upload and Moderation System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the video upload and moderation system into 5 subtasks covering the data model, file upload with validation, storage configuration, moderation workflow, and user agreement implementation",
      "reasoning": "This task requires handling large file uploads, format validation, secure storage, and a moderation workflow. The different user tiers (free/premium) add complexity to the implementation. Security and performance considerations are critical."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Messaging System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the messaging system implementation into 4 subtasks covering the data model, UI development, user limits/blocking functionality, and the reporting/moderation system",
      "reasoning": "While messaging is a common feature, this implementation includes several advanced features like user limits based on status, blocking, and a reporting system with moderation workflow. These additional requirements increase the complexity beyond a basic messaging system."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Search and Watchlist Features",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the search and watchlist feature implementation into 4 subtasks covering advanced search functionality with filters, database optimization, watchlist management, and role-specific capabilities",
      "reasoning": "The search functionality requires efficient database queries with proper indexing for performance. The role-specific capabilities and advanced filtering options add complexity. The watchlist feature adds state management requirements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Create Training Plan System",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the training plan system into 4 subtasks covering the data model design, UI for plan creation, assignment functionality, and progress tracking implementation",
      "reasoning": "This feature is moderately complex with a straightforward data model but requires a flexible UI for plan customization. The progress tracking adds some complexity but overall this is a more contained feature compared to others."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Premium Membership Logic",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the premium membership system into 4 subtasks covering user model extension, free trial implementation, upgrade paths with payment placeholders, and feature limitation logic",
      "reasoning": "This task involves extending the user model and implementing feature limitations based on membership status. The payment integration is only a placeholder, which reduces complexity. The task touches multiple parts of the system but each component is relatively straightforward."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Admin and Moderation Dashboard",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the admin and moderation dashboard implementation into 5 subtasks covering custom admin views, abuse report workflow, user management tools, metrics dashboard, and content moderation functionality",
      "reasoning": "This task requires extending Django's admin interface with custom views and workflows. It touches multiple parts of the system (videos, users, reports) and requires implementing complex workflows for moderation. The metrics dashboard adds additional complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement GDPR Compliance and Security Features",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the GDPR compliance and security implementation into 6 subtasks covering policy pages, data export/deletion workflows, cookie consent, security configurations, audit logging, and parental consent verification",
      "reasoning": "GDPR compliance is inherently complex and touches every part of the system. This task includes data export/deletion workflows, consent mechanisms, security configurations, and audit logging. The legal requirements and cross-cutting nature make this a high-complexity task."
