      "taskTitle": "Implement Role-Based User Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a Django-based role-based authentication system with 7 different user roles, custom registration flows, parent-child relationships, and email verification into 6 distinct subtasks with clear deliverables",
      "reasoning": "This task involves extending Django's User model with multiple roles, creating custom registration flows with validation, implementing parent-child relationships, and setting up email verification. The complexity is high due to the number of roles and custom workflows required."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Player Profile Management",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the player profile management system implementation into 5 subtasks, including model creation with numerous fields, interactive position selection UI, parental consent workflow, verification system with external API integration, and privacy controls",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating a complex data model with many fields, building a specialized UI for position selection, implementing age verification with external API integration, and creating a parental consent workflow. The variety of features and external integration increases complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Build Video Upload and Moderation System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the video upload and moderation system into 5 subtasks covering model creation, file upload with validation, user limits based on membership status, moderation workflow, and secure storage configuration",
      "reasoning": "This task involves handling file uploads with validation, implementing different limits based on user status, creating a moderation workflow, and configuring secure storage. The combination of file handling, conditional business logic, and moderation workflow makes this moderately complex."
